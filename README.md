# Treasure-Hunt
I made this game while studying OS in my 2nd year of BSCS from FAST. I have used the concepts of multithreading. Multiple players are playing. Each player has it's own thread that controls it's operations and queue through which it contacts with main thread. This allows concurrent access and eleminates race conditons. I hope you like this effort!

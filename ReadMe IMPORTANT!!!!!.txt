Tools used: SFML(Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) used along with Visual Studio Code, Programmed in C++.
Estimated Hours Spent: Countless ;)
Acceptance: The project is complete based on the requirements stated, but the final result is yet to be polished in order for it to publish publically.
Best part of the Game: The most fun part was designing the random positions of items which was guided by the board positions. It was done so beautifully within just a few lines that takes my breath away. Everytime, positions changes. Second most beautiful aspect of game is the BOT that I designed. It's movement is totally RANDOM and it's faster than the user.
Hope you enjoy this effort!
